## Introduction
#### Why write tests?
At the year 2017, listing the reasons of testing is weird. Actually writing tests had to be accepted as a common rule of development, and it should be a phase of development. At _Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing Code_, Martin Fowler states the importance of tests as a “the first step of refactoring”. At _Test-Driven Development
By Example_, Kent Beck analogize the testing as "turning on the light, while exploring a dark house".  
These thougts about testing remains the same, regardless of what framework and what technology you use. Thankfully, Ember.js comes with a testing infrastructure that use qunit and phantomjs behind the scenes. Ember CLI provides builtin testing mechanisms.
